        <h2 className="text-primary">ISMS Process Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Planning the required processes alone is insufficient for a fully functioning ISMS. The organization must
          also ensure that processes required by ISO/IEC 27001 standard are both implemented and controlled in
          accordance with the requirements. The method by which the organization ensures that processes meet these
          requirements involves defining the guidelines for the processes and applying process control that aligns
          with the specified criteria.

        <p>
          In the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, the organization is required to establish information risk assessment and
          information security risk treatment processes. These processes must be implemented and used regularly, either periodically or in response to significant changes. The organization must conduct these assessments in strict accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 requirements, and the results of these assessments must be documented and retained as part of the organizationâ€™s records.
